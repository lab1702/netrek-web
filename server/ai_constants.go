// AI Constants for Bot Behavior
// These constants control various aspects of bot AI behavior, particularly
// shield management and threat assessment. Centralizing these values makes
// the AI more maintainable and allows for easier tuning and testing.

	// These control when bots will activate shields based on available fuel
	FuelCritical  = 400  // Emergency threshold - only shield for immediate threats
	FuelLow       = 600  // Low fuel - shield for close threats
	FuelModerate = 1400 // Moderate fuel - shield for medium-range threats
	FuelGood     = 2000 // Good fuel reserves - shield more liberally

	// Threat Assessment Constants
