# Security Review Report - Netrek Web

## Executive Summary
This security review identifies several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in the Netrek Web application that require immediate attention. The application lacks essential security controls including authentication, rate limiting, and proper resource management.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. **CRITICAL: Unrestricted Shutdown API Endpoint**
**Location:** `main.go:51-63`
- The `/api/shutdown` endpoint allows anyone to shut down the server without authentication
- No authorization checks or IP restrictions
- Can be exploited for denial of service attacks
- **Recommendation:** Remove this endpoint or implement strong authentication and IP whitelisting

### 2. **CRITICAL: No Authentication System**
**Impact:** Anyone can join with any name and impersonate other players
- No user registration or login system
- Player names are client-controlled without verification
- No session management or tokens
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper authentication with JWT tokens or session management

### 3. **HIGH: Lack of Rate Limiting**
**Impact:** Server vulnerable to resource exhaustion and DoS attacks
- No connection rate limiting per IP
- No message rate limiting per client
- No limits on bot creation commands
- WebSocket connections have no throttling
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting using middleware (e.g., golang.org/x/time/rate)

## High-Severity Vulnerabilities

### 4. **HIGH: Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities**
**Location:** Multiple locations
- Unbounded slice growth for torpedoes/plasmas (`websocket.go:1071, 1254`)
- No limit on concurrent WebSocket connections
- Bot commands like `/fillbots` can consume all server resources
- Send channel buffers can grow without bounds (`websocket.go:105, 177`)
- **Recommendation:** Implement resource limits and connection caps

### 5. **HIGH: Weak Input Validation**
**Location:** `handlers.go`
- Name sanitization is too permissive (`handlers.go:28-44`)
- Message length limit of 500 chars may be too large for spam
- No validation of numerical inputs for overflow
- **Recommendation:** Strengthen input validation and add numerical bounds checking

### 6. **HIGH: Docker Container Security Issues**
**Location:** `Dockerfile`
- Uses unpinned `golang` base image (line 2)
- Runs as root user (no USER directive)
- Installs from latest without version pinning (line 5)
- **Recommendation:** Pin base image version, add non-root user, pin application version

## Medium-Severity Vulnerabilities

### 7. **MEDIUM: Weak WebSocket Origin Validation**
**Location:** `websocket.go:19-56`
- Accepts any origin if Origin header is missing
- Localhost origins always allowed even in production
- No configurable whitelist for production domains
- **Recommendation:** Implement strict origin validation with configurable whitelist

### 8. **MEDIUM: Information Disclosure**
**Location:** Various
- Error messages may leak internal state
- No log sanitization for sensitive data
- Team statistics endpoint exposes player counts without auth
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper error handling and log sanitization

### 9. **MEDIUM: Missing Security Headers**
**Impact:** Client-side vulnerabilities
- No Content-Security-Policy header
- No X-Frame-Options header
- No X-Content-Type-Options header
- **Recommendation:** Add security headers to all HTTP responses

### 10. **MEDIUM: Potential Integer Overflow**
**Location:** Multiple calculations
- Frame counter increments indefinitely (`websocket.go:204`)
- Score/kill counters have no bounds
- Timer calculations could overflow
- **Recommendation:** Add overflow checks or use appropriate data types

## Low-Severity Issues

### 11. **LOW: Outdated Go Version**
**Location:** `go.mod:3`
- Specifies Go 1.25 which doesn't exist (likely meant 1.21)
- May miss security patches
- **Recommendation:** Use a valid, current Go version (1.21 or 1.22)

### 12. **LOW: Weak Random Number Generation**
**Location:** Various uses of `math/rand`
- Uses math/rand instead of crypto/rand for game elements
- Not cryptographically secure (acceptable for game logic)
- **Recommendation:** Use crypto/rand for any security-sensitive randomness

### 13. **LOW: Missing HTTPS/TLS**
- Server only supports HTTP
- WebSocket connections are unencrypted (ws://)
- **Recommendation:** Add TLS support with proper certificates

## Positive Security Features

- HTML escaping for chat messages prevents XSS (`handlers.go:17-25`)
- WebSocket compression reduces bandwidth usage
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Some input validation present (team, ship type validation)
- Embedded static files reduce path traversal risks

## Recommendations Priority

### Immediate (Critical)
1. Remove or secure the shutdown endpoint
2. Implement authentication system
3. Add rate limiting middleware

### Short-term (High)
1. Add resource limits and connection caps
2. Strengthen input validation
3. Fix Docker security issues
4. Implement security headers

### Medium-term (Medium)
1. Improve origin validation
2. Add comprehensive logging with sanitization
3. Implement HTTPS/TLS support
4. Add monitoring and alerting

### Long-term (Enhancement)
1. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
2. Add intrusion detection
3. Implement security testing in CI/CD
4. Regular dependency scanning

## Testing Recommendations

1. Perform penetration testing focusing on:
   - DoS attacks via resource exhaustion
   - WebSocket message flooding
   - Bot command abuse
   - Input validation bypasses

2. Implement automated security scanning:
   - Static analysis with gosec
   - Dependency scanning with Nancy or Snyk
   - Container scanning with Trivy

3. Load testing to establish safe limits for:
   - Concurrent connections
   - Messages per second
   - Game entities (torpedoes, plasmas)

## Conclusion

The Netrek Web application has several critical security vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service, resource exhaustion, and unauthorized access. The most critical issue is the unauthenticated shutdown endpoint, followed by the complete lack of authentication and rate limiting.

While the application does implement some security measures like HTML escaping, these are insufficient for a production deployment. Immediate action should be taken to address the critical vulnerabilities before exposing this application to the public internet.

The game logic itself appears safe and doesn't perform any dangerous operations, but the lack of protective controls around the application makes it vulnerable to abuse.
